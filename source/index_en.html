      <h2 class="title-section">LABHacker?</h2>
      <p class="sectiontext">LABHacker is the civic innovation laboratory of the Brazilian Parliament
        and focuses on three themes: transparency, participation and citizenship, fostering collaborative
        and experimental projects. The Lab also has the objective of articulating a network of
        representatives, public servants, civic hackers and civil society organizations which contribute
        to a culture of transparency and social participation through public data management.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title-section">Our lines of action</h3>
      <div class="thingswedo">
        <h4>Citizen participation</h4>
        <img src="images/grapheme5.svg" alt="Participação"/>
        <p>The LABHacker encourages the development of actions and tools which amplify social participation in the legislative process. We manage the <a href="https://edemocracia.camara.leg.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-Democracia Portal of the Brazilian Parliament</a>,
          which showcases multiple participation models, such as interacting in public hearings,
          collaborative editing of law proposals and thematic debates.Other government bodies and outside entities are also able to run their
          own version of the <a href="https://edemocracia.leg.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-Democracia</a> platform. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="thingswedo">
        <h4>Transparency</h4>
        <img src="images/grapheme2.svg" alt="Transparência" />
        <p>We incentivize the development of digital applications that allow for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McH7GINO6Ng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intuitive and simplified visualization of legislative information</a>.
        We produce <a href="https://medium.com/labhacker/labhacker-abre-c%C3%B3digo-do-portal-e-democracia-25cb00239724"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source tools</a> and release them on Github for use by other public bodies.
         We collaboratively implemented the <a href="https://www.parlamentoaberto.leg.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parlamento Aberto Portal</a>, inspiring other legislative houses in transparency, participation, and social control.
         In 2018, we aim at enhancing citizen comprehension in legislative votings with
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GqUcjJxvoM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">innovative experiences</a>  in the plenary's backstage.

          citizens' best interest at heart.

              <span class="name">Participation in interactive hearings</span>
              <p>In addition to live-streaming the public hearings of the Chamber of Deputies' commissions, it is now also possible <a href = "https://edemocracia.camara.leg.br/audiencias/sala/5" target = "_ blank" rel = "noopener" > to send questions on the topic of debate </a> through the "Audiências Interativas" tool (included in the e-Democracy portal), developed by LABHacker. The questions most voted by the citizens themselves are read and answered live during the event by the deputies or guests. The answers are tagged on the video and at any time it is possible to search the audience room to have access to the whole video, the questions asked and their answers. There is also a chat for interaction between users during the event.</p>

              <span class="name">Collaborative project editing</span>
              <p>Wikilegis is an e-Democracy tool developed by LABHacker that allows citizens to actively participate in the construction of laws with representatives reporting on the projects. People interested in a certain topic can <a href="https://edemocracia.camara.leg.br/wikilegis/bill/46" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> forward suggestions for changes in the text: </a> article by article, make comments and supporting or rejecting the proposal in full or in part. Collective contributions are presented in an organized and structured manner, facilitating the analysis and possible incorporation of suggestions into the final law text by the deputy. Through this functionality, thousands of Internet users contributed to the drafting of laws such as the Civil Procedure Code, the "Marco Civil da Internet", the Statute of the Person with Disabilities, the Youth Statute, among others.</p>

              <p> One of the tools of the e-Democracy Portal, the Participatory Agenda was developed in 2017 for citizens to be able to help in the elaboration of the agenda of discussions by choosing for analysis by the Plenary the proposals they think should take priority. The <a href="https://edemocracia.camara.leg.br/pautaparticipativa/pauta/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pilot project </a> was carried out in September and had 7,585 participants, who voted for proposals in the areas of health, security and politics. The entire process was monitored and evaluated by specialists in social participation. The documenting of this work, including the evaluation of the participating citizens and information on the methodology used (D21), is available on the page. </p>

As one of the milestones of this commitment the group built in a collaborative and open manner the <a href="http://bit.ly/guiadoparlamentoaberto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Guide to an Open Parliament</a>, to guide in a practical way the aspects of transparency, social participation and social control in Parliament. Other milestones of the commitment are the construction of the Portal <a href="http://www.parlamentoaberto.leg.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Open Parliament </a> - with standards, tools, training, Open Parliament guidelines and practices and the provision of <a href="http://www.edemocracia.leg.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> e-Democracia </a> as one of the platforms offered by the Interlegis program to spread the use of the tool to all legislative houses in the country. </p>

              <p> LABHacker works on the development of a platform that will facilitate the analysis of political manifestations. This collaborative repository called Babel will have information gathered from social networks, pronouncements, official publications, news, blogs and other entries. This will enable software and data analysts to cross-check this information and understand the position of any person or institution on political issues. </p>

              <p>LABHacker encourages the creation of multidisciplinary study groups with participants from various public bodies to deepen the debate and disseminate good practices on topics related to <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqiFjCF_dtcwRE_69KmkymznLmhNT_8kF "target =" _ blank "rel =" noopener "> social media </a> and <a href =" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqiFjCF_dtcz_Us2fGqIDwAzhT_TUh6EO "target =" _ blank "rel =" noopener " > network analysis</a>. These studies are carried out every two weeks and broadcast live on Youtube, so that all interested parties can participate or have subsequent access to the debate.</p>

              <p> One of the new experiments of the LAB is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GqUcjJxvoM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 360 degree project,</a> in which the citizen can follow from within the plenary of the Chamber of Deputies the vote on some important proposal for society. LABHacker believes that projects like this are essential to increase the Parliament's transparency and facilitate society's understanding of the legislative process. </p>

              <p>We host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqiFjCF_dtczKNM4d6PphhqCPIXR73y6n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talks on challenging themes</a>, such as new technologies and innovation in the public service to stimulate civil servants, employees, parliamentarians, civic hackers, students and other interested parties. The agenda for these debates is always published on all LABHacker social networks and the presentations are broadcast live on YouTube.</p>

              <span class="name">Dissemination of the culture of social participation</span>
              <p>A Partnership between the Parliament, Senate and Interlegis in 2018 now allows the e-Democracy portal, which is a social participation platform developed by LABHacker to be distributed to Legislative Chambers and Assemblies across the country. The first municipality to use the platform for its citizens is Três Corações, in Minas Gerais. </p>
              <p> In Brasília, the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, Anvisa and Anac are already working with the <a href="http://www.edemocracia.leg.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> platform </a>. In April, the French Parliament reported its interest in e-Democracy. This technology transfer should pave the way for other countries to start using the social participation tool, which is free and modular. </p>

              <span class="name">Advice for the institutionalization of civic innovations</span>
              <p> LABHacker started the <a href="http://labhackercd.leg.br/plip" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> debate </a> for the creation of the People's Initiative Digital Bill  (<a href="http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/prop_mostrarintegra?codteor=1639627&filename=Tramitacao-PL+7574/2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PL 7574/17 </a>), which facilitates citizens' lives and social participation by allowing the petition of the population to be electronically forwarded and to receive proposals from popular initiatives. This debate, which included everything from the possibility of using Blockchain technology in the legislative process to checking citizens' data through the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) database and other technical issues, had the fundamental participation of consultants from the Chamber, parliamentarians and experts. Now the project is ready to be voted on by the Chamber of Deputies' Plenary. </p>
              <p> Another proposition that was supported by LABHacker was <a href = "http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/prop_mostrarintegra;jsessionid=22CCB8CBD65D4C7335501F1BF35E7D5D.proposicoesWeb1?codteor=16288it&filename> / 2017 "target =" _ blank "rel =" noopener "> PRC 217/2017 </a>, which institutionalizes citizen participation and expands the transparency of the legislative process in the Chamber of Deputies. </p>
